### Description:
The F5 WAFs will be fully configured in front of your application with the base Security Blocking template that you choose.  When completed, the WAFs will pass traffic through the newly created public IP address.  After some testing to make sure everything is working, you will want to complete the configuration by changing the DNS entry for your application to point at the newly created public IP address, and then locking down the Network Security Group rules to prevent any traffic from reaching your application except through the F5 WAFs.
